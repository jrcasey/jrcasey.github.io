### A bit about me
Postdoc at **[MIT](https://eapsweb.mit.edu)**  
Research Affiliate at **[UH Mānoa](https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soestwp/)**  

> *I'm interested in the coordination and optimization of cellular scale processes, how objectives - like fitness or entropy production - are influenced by the streams of information between tiers of biological organization, and how all this complexity is imprinted in the genetic code. I enjoy thinking about these layers of biological complexity as they relate to the ecology and biogeochemistry of the oceans.* [More](/about/)
