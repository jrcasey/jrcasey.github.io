# jrcasey.github.io/ - My academic homepage
A page with information about my lovely self. I'm currently on the second iteration of my first GH Pages website, but learning as I go. Currently using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme - if you'd like to use this theme consider [tipping](https://www.paypal.me/mmistakes) the author, Michael Rose!  

# Resources
Here are a few recommendations to help with building a site like this one:  
I use [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) for local rendering of markdown pages before I push changes. I use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com) for my terminal with a [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) shell and [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) to pretty things up. I use [TextMate](https://macromates.com) for editing just about everything, even when I probably should be using vim.
