What happens if the photosynthetic and respiratory quotients are not counter-balanced?


#### [CBIOMES Project](/CBIOMESResearch/)

Ongoing research with the Simons Foundation Collaboration on Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems. Watch a narrated slide show of what's in the works and check out a case-study applying detailed mechanistic models of *Prochlorococcus* physiology and metabolism across an eddy-dipole.  

#### [Nutrient Uptake](/nutrientUptake/)
<img src="/assets/images/Figure_5.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="600">  

Check out our mechanistic model of substrate limited microbial growth kinetics. A way to derive nutrient transport rates from physiological data and genome-scale models. Easier than it sounds!  

#### [Some thoughts about Monod, Droop and Blackman](/MonodDroopBlackman/)
<img src="/assets/images/Figure_3.jpg" alt="Figure 5" width="600">  

Some thoughts about Monod, Droop and Blackman, and how to reconcile them with a mechanistic model.
