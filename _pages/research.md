Ongoing research with the Simons Foundation Collaboration on Biogeochemical Modeling of Marine Ecosystems. Watch a narrated slide show of what's in the works and check out a case-study applying detailed mechanistic models of *Prochlorococcus* physiology and metabolism across an eddy-dipole.  

#### [Nutrient Uptake](/nutrientUptake/)

Check out our mechanistic model of substrate limited microbial growth kinetics. A way to derive nutrient transport rates from physiological data and genome-scale models. Easier than it sounds!  

#### [Some thoughts about Monod, Droop and Blackman](/MonodDroopBlackman/)

Some thoughts about Monod, Droop and Blackman, and how to reconcile them with a mechanistic model.
